Thanks, please add a blank between words and parenthesis:
models(lm) --> models (lm)

Please do not capitalize "Fittings" in your Description text.

Please do not comment out your examples and use \donttest{} instead:

\examples{
  examples for users and checks:
  executable in < 5 sec

  donttest{
      further examples for users (not used for checks)
  }
}

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Swetlana Herbrandt

## Resubmission comment

I have added a blank between words and parenthesis:
models(lm) --> models (lm)

I have changed "Fittings" --> "fittings" in Description text.

I have used \donttest{} in my examples.

Thank you very much for your time !
